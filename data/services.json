Our team worked to inform decision-making on community forests in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo to protect the critically endangered Eastern Lowland (Grauer’s) gorilla while simultaneously improving the wellbeing of local communities. For this project, I was the project manager and led the development of the project from the proposal through the final presentation and recommendations."
